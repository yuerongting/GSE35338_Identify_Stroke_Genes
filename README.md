# GSE137482_Identify_Stroke_Genes
Work that searching for stroke-related genes using systems biology method using WGCNA (paper "WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis": https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-559) and Limma (paper: "limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies ": https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/43/7/e47/2414268). Limma code is adapted from Jimmy Zeng's work which can be found in: https://github.com/jmzeng1314/GEO.
